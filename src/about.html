  <p>
    I am <strong>Austin Birch</strong> &mdash; an entrepreneur, developer,
    and design enthusiast.
  </p>

  <p class="hire-me-maybe">
    I am available for work (full-time / part-time software development
    position).
  </p>

  <p>
    At the moment I programming mainly using JavaScript, on both the server
    (<a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js)</a>, and the browser, building a
    client-side web application. Getting used to the oddities of JavaScript
    after spending time with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
    has been quite a challenge! I am also currently learning about functional
    rogramming, and the concepts that go with it (for example, immutablity and
    pure functions) via <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I co-founded <a href="http://madebybottle.co.uk">Bottle</a>, where
    we are creating an extensible CRM application for smaller businesses.
    Trying to build an application that is well balanced in both flexibility
    and simplicity is a challenge that I am enjoying.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are part of a small technology startup, we would love to talk to you
    about what you need from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application,
    get in touch (below) and we could grab a beer and get you beta access to
    BottleCRM.
