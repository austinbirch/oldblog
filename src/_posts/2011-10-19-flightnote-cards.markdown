The promotional/business card for [flightnote](https://flightnote.co.uk) have been
printed. The final design is very similar to the paper-based mockups that I created
before.

Here they are:

And to compare them to the paper-based mockups that I created:

The final prints are exactly what I imagined they would be, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more
pleased. The printing company were effortlessly professsional, which made the whole
printing experience painless.

I&rsquo;ll be attaching some promotional codes to a few of these, and then sending them
out very soon. I can&rsquo;t wait!
