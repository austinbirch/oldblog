drop_dead is now a (virtually) complete single-player game!

![drop_dead](/assets/img/drop_dead_single_player.png "drop_dead single-player")

There are ten levels to beat, each with a differing level of difficulty.

You should really give it a go [here](http://austinbirch.co.uk/drop_dead/).

Let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/austinbirch) if you beat it, with an attached
screenshot, &amp; I will put you on the drop_dead page labelled as a cool person.
