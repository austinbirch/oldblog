[![drop_dead](/assets/img/ai.png)](/drop_dead/)

Things I have added:
* Added a very very simple AI that is brilliantly annoying as an opponent.
* Simple life system &amp; ability to restart when dead too, which is nice.

The AI will be removed when the multiplayer features are added but it is helpful not to
have to try and control two players to test the game.

Check it out [here](/drop_dead/), and let me know what you think
