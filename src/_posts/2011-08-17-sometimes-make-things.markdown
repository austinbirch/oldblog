title: Sometimes, Make Things

When designing things which are intended for print, it’s all too easy to sit in front of
software and make endless adjustments, but never really knowing what the end product is
going to be like as a physical object.

Sometimes, you should make things. For [flightnote](https://flightnote.co.uk), I am
creating some promotional &rdquo;Business Cards&ldquo; to give away. I wanted them to be a
little different than the traditional rectangular ordeal, so I’ve been experimenting with
a few different options.

The idea that I have settled on is a circular card, with colour
on both sides.

However, until I made some mock versions, I was not entirely sure. Making something you
can touch and try is really worth it. Even if the materials are not right, and the
printing is not great, you still get a feel for **how** it will work.

Making cheap, quick, mockups reduce the risk of making a large mistake later on. You can
make as many as you like and make as many changes as you want, allowing for lots of
exploration.

I made these mockups out of paper that I roughly cut into 2.5&#x2033; circles, and then
glued the front and back sides together. I am now sure that this is the idea I want to
follow. All that remains is to finalise the design, and find somewhere that wil print
them.
