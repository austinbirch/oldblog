title: Early Esc Spritesheet
layout: post

As a little sneak preview of my upcoming iOS game, Esc, here is an early spritesheet
(well, a section of) that might give a feel for the art direction of the game.

Obviously it draws lots of inspiration from [VVVVVV](http://thelettervsixtim.es/) in terms
of art style, and as I&rsquo;m using a modified C64 colour palette, the C64 in general.

The game itself is heavily based on the ideas of my
[Ludum Dare Entry](/2011/08/24/ludum-postmortem.html), and I found Ludum Dare to be a
great way to test game ideas &mdash; it&rsquo;s kind of like releasing a traditional
MVP.

There is still lots to finish before releasing Esc, but the major structure is therem, and
it feels promising.

I&rsquo;ll post updates here when I feel I have something worth reporting.
