drop_dead is a multiplayer HTML5 Canvas/WebSockets experiment that I am playing with,
in order to familiarise myself with those technologies. I will open-source it when I have
got it to a point in which it is usable at all &mdash; and that should be soon. View
Source if you are really too impatient for that.

I will try and keep an updated version available [here](/drop_dead/), but it will be
completely broken, and equally unfinished, at various points in time.

The basic concept of the game is this:
* Players try to drop blocks on other players heads
* If you are dropping blocks on runners, points for hitting them
* If you are a runner, points for climbing on droppped blocks and reaching the top
* Winners from both sides are players which have the most points

It is a bit of a combination of some currently popular ideas.

Try it out, and let me know what you think about it on
