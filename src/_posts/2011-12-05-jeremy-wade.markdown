There is no rule that states that inspirational people have to be working it the same
field as you. I met somebody that is inspirational to me
[Jeremy Wade](http://www.jeremywade.co.uk/)
([Wikipedia](http://animal.discovery.com/tv/river-monsters/)).

He is somebody that both physically, and metaphorically, explores beneath the surface to
discover what is really there.

I feel privileged to have met somebody that is so dedicated to their field, and that has
such a brilliantly expansive domain knowledge.
