title: Gesture Based Interfaces

As much as gesture based interface feel like the future, I think that some care
needs to be taken in making sure that gestures fit the context.

There has been a recent influx of apps, especially on the iOS platform, that
require gestures to be used for nearly all interactions.

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love gestures in apps, and I use them often. However like all
good design, I think that they need to be well thought out if they are to improve the user
experience. It&rsquo;s all to easy to let new interaction methods be implemented as
gimmicks, rather than as good design.

I know this from experience, as I prototyped a note-taking app that was gesture driven. It
was visually appealing, and I really liked the concept. However, when I stepped back and
considered what the gestures added to the experience, I found that it was mostly extra
work for the user.

Like most design problems, using the right amount of gestures is extremely context
specific, so there is not a sinle solution that fits every problem. However, it is
definitely worth giving it the careful attention that it deserves.
