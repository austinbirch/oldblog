I easily overwork. And I usually tell myself that it is not a bad thing. I read
continuously that it is a bad habit, and still tell myself that working non-stop is fine.
It is as though I think myself to be the exception to the rule. It has become clear
however, that it is just unsustainable. I won&rsquo;t be doing it again.

I will allow myself time to do **something different**. It can and will be anything.
Side-projects, reading, writing, or whatever else that is not my current attention drain.

## For the last while
I have been working non-stop on [flightnote](https://flightnote.co.uk).
Which is something I love doing, but I have not really done anything else at all, if you
don&rsquo;t include working another (though simple) job too. Lately I reached a point in
which working on flightnote was a journey of frustration until something was achieved.
I would just continue working, haphazardly, until I finished what I was working on.
It could have been a simple bug-fix or feature, yet I would be riddled with frustration
until it was done. Most often, I would get it finished, but the journey wouldn't feel as
*natural* as it usually felt. I ended up feeling quite dissatisfied with things,
and not happy with a half-hearted implementation of whatever that specific to-do might
have been.

## Things will change, though.
The first two days of this week I spent with my girlfriend, painting her room and
constructing a new bed. This was a welcome break, and though it was not something most
would consider leisure time, fun, or a break &mdash; I did consider it to be.I thoroughly
enjoyed it and it gave me time to slow my brain down, which in turn, give me some time to
think clearly. It is surprising how much more efficient doing something completely
unrelated can be, when compared to just pushing on regardless.

## Sometimes, you just need to stop.
Stop and take some time. Stop and let yourself recover a little bit. Maybe not a full
recovery, as a little bit of pressure can be quite useful. However, do stop and take a
moment to collect. Everybody can be overworked. You just end up becoming less efficient
&mdash; you start going backwards.

Anyway, I must get back to doing some work.
