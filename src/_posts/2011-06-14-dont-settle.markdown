Things that make you work smarter, are worth it. Don&rsquo;t think any other way.
If you can afford (sensibly) to purchase something that you think will make a real impact
to the way you work, you owe it to yourself to do it.

If you spend lots of time using a piece of equipment, be it a touchable physical item, or
a piece of software, you should ensure you use things which allow you to be more
productive.

## An example:
I listen to music whilst I work, I find it makes me more productive. Spending hours
wearing a pair of headphones that are not comfortable, or that don’t sound right,
reduces some of that extra productivity. I very recently invested in a nicer pair of
headphones &mdash; [AKG Q460s](http://uk.akg.com/product-detail-2821/q460wht.html).

They sound **great**, and are very very comfortable. I no longer spend time getting
frustrated with uncomfortable and poor sounding headphones. A tiny distraction like that
can ruin a long run of productivity. The tiny distractions all add up to have a large
effect.

## Don&rsquo;t settle for something that is not right.
Don&rsquo;t settle for that software which only nearly does what you need, or that okay
chair (a chair is a chair, right?), don&rsquo;t settle for that mouse that will
&ldquo;just do.&rdquo; Spend the extra money if you can, and you will reap the rewards.
