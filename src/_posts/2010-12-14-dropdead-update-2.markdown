[![drop_dead](/assets/img/collision_detection.png)](/drop_dead/)

The player can now fall of of blocks, using horrendously inefficient collision detection,
but at least he does not hang about in the air indefinitely. I will rewrite all of the
collision detection later, for now I just want to try and get on to WebSockets and adding
a simple scoring system now!

Let me know what you think on [twitter](https://twitter.com/austinbirch/).
