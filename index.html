      <p>As much as gesture based interface feel like the future, I think that some care needs to be taken in making sure that gestures fit the context.</p>

<p>There has been a recent influx of apps, especially on the iOS platform, that require gestures to be used for nearly all interactions.</p>

<p>To scratch an itch, I built <a href='https://www.chessable.co.uk'>chessable</a>. chessable is a correspondence chess game with an uncluttered and responsive interface.</p>

<p>I created it a few weeks ago, as other similar services were cluttered with ads, and laden with extra features. I wanted something simpler to use.</p>

      <p>Last weekend I took part, for the first time, in <a href='http://ludumdare.com'>Ludum Dare</a>, a competition in which you have <strong>48</strong> hours to create a game from scratch. I&#8217;ll be doing the next one too.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t usually make games, but I enjoyed the challenge. As Rails 3.1 will use <a href='http://coffeescript.org/'>CoffeeScript</a> by default, I thought it would be the perfect change to get to know it a bit better.</p>

      <p>When designing things which are intended for print, it’s all too easy to sit in front of software and make endless adjustments, but never really knowing what the end product is going to be like as a physical object.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you should make things. For <a href='https://flightnote.co.uk'>flightnote</a>, I am creating some promotional &#8221;Business Cards&#8220; to give away. I wanted them to be a little different than the traditional rectangular ordeal, so I’ve been experimenting with a few different options.</p>

      <p>I easily overwork. And I usually tell myself that it is not a bad thing. I read continuously that it is a bad habit, and still tell myself that working non-stop is fine.
