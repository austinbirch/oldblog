title: "drop_dead: a bit more playable!"

I have added a target height for the running player to reach, and added the ability for
the AI player to be switched on and off.

The life system is also working, so it is more playable than it was &mdash; you can win
&amp; you can lose.

Find someone else, and play it [here](/drop_dead/), then let me know what you think on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/austinbirch/).
