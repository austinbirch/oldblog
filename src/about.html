  <p>
    I am <strong>Austin Birch</strong> &mdash; an entrepreneur, developer,
    and design enthusiast.
  </p>

  <p>
    I co-founded <a href="http://madebybottle.co.uk">Bottle</a>, where
    we are creating an extensible CRM application for smaller businesses.
    Trying to build an application that is well balanced in both flexibility
    and simplicity is a challenge that I am enjoying.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are part of a small technology startup, we would love to talk to you
    about what you need from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application,
    get in touch (below) and we could grab a beer and get you beta access to
    BottleCRM.
