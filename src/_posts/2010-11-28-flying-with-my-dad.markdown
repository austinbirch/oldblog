I managed to the chance to take my Dad out for his first flight with me on the 26th of
this month. It turned out to be a really good day, as the weather was perfect, though it
was a little cold (below zero before leaving! I had to de-ice the aeroplane).

My Dad thoroughly enjoyed himself, and as the weather had postponed our numerous prior
plans, he deserved the lovely weather.
