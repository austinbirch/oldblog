## Profile

- A motivated, hard working individual that enjoys solving complex problems.
- An eager, self-driven learner, always looking for ways to develop a deeper
  understanding and new things to learn.
- Successfully self-funded and gained Private Pilot Licence at the age of 19,
  having only recorded a few hours over the minimum required to attain it – even
  though training school closures caused material to be revisited.
- Created software that solves problems for myself and others, and released it
  into the public.
- Experimented with many programming languages and technologies in order to
  develop an understanding of software development.

## Additional Skills

- Full clean UK licence that I have held since January 2009.
- Obtained my Private Pilot Licence in June 2010. Before training for my PPL,
  I was a member of the Portsmouth Naval Gliding Club based in Lee-On-Solent,
  training in gliders. I moved on to do a small amount of training there for my
  PPL, following closure of the school I continued training at Shoreham.
- Experience with a variety of programming/scripting languages, that I have
  developed upon in my own time. Examples include: C++, Objective-C, Java,
  JavaScript, Ruby, and Visual Basic. Also skilled with HTML/CSS, and various
  other markup languages.
- Experience with multiple Operating Systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X), and
  experience with database technologies such as: MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.


## Interests

Developing my understanding of software, by creating it in my spare time.  
Notable examples:

- **flightnote**
  - A web application built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, HTML5 & CSS3,
  JavaScript, and CoffeeScript. _flightnote_ is a social logbook keeping
  application for recreational pilots.

- **chessable** ([https://bitbucket.org/austinbirch/chessable](https://bitbucket.org/austinbirch/chessable))
  - _chessable_ is correspondence chess for casual players, allowing them to
  make moves from various devices. It was created to fill a niche in the
  market for this type of application. It is powered by a mixture of Ruby on
  Rails, HTML5 & CSS3, CoffeeScript, JavaScript, and MongoDB.

- **drop\_dead** (Source code:
  [https://github.com/austinbirch/drop_dead](https://github.com/austinbirch/drop_dead))
  - A HTML5 Canvas game using JavaScript to power the logic, and the HTML5
  Canvas drawing API to render the game.

- **65-73-63** (Source code:
  [https://github.com/austinbirch/65-73-63](https://github.com/austinbirch/65-73-63))
  - A Ludum Dare game competition entry, in which participants are required to
  make a game from scratch in 48 hours.

- Wrote the beginnings of an iOS app in C++. The application required a custom 
  volumetric rendering engine that leveraged OpenGL for performance.

- **simperium-wrapper** ([https://bitbucket.org/austinbirch/simperium-wrapper/overview](https://bitbucket.org/austinbirch/simperium-wrapper/overview))
  - An API wrapper for the Simperium 
    ([https://simperium.com/](https://simperium.com/)) database service,
    written for node.js using CoffeeScript.

My other interests include cycling, reading (especially fiction), playing
guitar, flying, and socialising with friends.
