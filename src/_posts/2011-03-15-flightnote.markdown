Enter [flightnote](http://flightnote.co.uk), a web application, under development by me,
for sharing your flying logbook.

When [flightnote](http://flightnote.co.uk) goes live, you will be able to keep an
**online backup of your flights**, **share media and notes from your flights**, and
**keep up to date with your friends flights too**. It is going to be great.

The idea behind [flightnote](http://flightnote.co.uk) is that logbooking on the computer
is very annoying &mdash; [flightnote](http://flightnote.co.uk) is going to solve this
problem. Entering your flights will be easy, and stress free.

You will also be able to print out your logbook (in the same format as your paper-based
logbook) and view statistics too mdash; us pilots love that sort of thing.

It will be mobile &mdash; using any recent smartphone or tablet (those that support HTML5
will work best), you will be able to update, view, and share whilst on the go.

There won&rsquo;t be any software to install or maintain &mdash; the application, and your
flight data, will live securely on the internet, giving you access to it from web browsers
on a variety of devices.

You should head to the [flightnote](http://flightnote.co.uk) site, and **subscribe to the
mailing list**. You will be alerted to launch dates, exciting news, and hopefully get some
excellent deals &amp; promotions too.

Get ready to experience logbook keeping in an entirely different way.
