I finally got around to watching **Indie Game: The Movie** today, and it was very, very
good. One of my favourite documentary films, along with
[Objectified](http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/) and
[Helvetica](http://www.helveticafilm.com/).

At $9.99, it is an absolute steal. [Get it here.](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/)
